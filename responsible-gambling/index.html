        <h2>Signs of Problem Gambling</h2>
        <p>
            Recognizing warning signs early is crucial for preventing gambling problems. Problem gambling can develop gradually, and many players don't realize they have developed an issue until it significantly impacts their lives. If you or someone you know experiences any of these signs, seeking help is important.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Warning Signs to Watch For</h3>
        <p>These indicators may suggest developing gambling problems:</p>
        <div class="table-wrapper">
            <table>
                <tr><th>Warning Sign</th><th>Description</th><th>Action to Take</th></tr>
                <tr><td>Loss of Control</td><td>Inability to stop gambling or stick to limits</td><td>Use self-exclusion tools immediately</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Chasing Losses</td><td>Playing longer to recover lost money</td><td>Take a break and reassess spending</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Increased Time/Money</td><td>Needing more time and larger bets for excitement</td><td>Set stricter limits or seek professional help</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Financial Strain</td><td>Gambling beyond your means or borrowing money</td><td>Contact a financial counselor and support line</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Neglected Responsibilities</td><td>Skipping work, family time, or other obligations</td><td>Speak with a counselor or therapist</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Secrecy & Denial</td><td>Hiding gambling activity from family or lying about spending</td><td>Reach out to a trusted friend or support service</td></tr>
            </table>
        </div>
        
        <h3>Quick Self-Assessment Questions</h3>
        <p>Ask yourself these important questions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>‚ùì Have I exceeded my budget for gaming this week or month?</li>
            <li>‚ùì Have I played longer than intended on multiple occasions?</li>
            <li>‚ùì Have friends or family expressed concern about my gaming habits?</li>
            <li>‚ùì Do I feel anxious or irritable when not gaming?</li>
            <li>‚ùì Have I lied about the amount of time or money spent on gaming?</li>
        </ul>
